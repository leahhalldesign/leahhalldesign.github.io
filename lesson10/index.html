        <h2>Notes</h2>  
        <h3>Validating Forms</h3> 
        <p>Form Validation is when you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application.</p>  
        <p>Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation features. This validation generally doesn't require much JavaScript. Built-in form validation has better performance than JavaScript, but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.</p>
        <p>JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use a library).</p>
        <p>required: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted.</p>
        <p>minlength and maxlength: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings).</p>
        <p>min and max: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types.</p>
        <p>type: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some other specific preset type. </p>
        <p>pattern: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow.</p>
        <p>When an element is valid, the following things are true:

            1. The element matches the :valid CSS pseudo-class, which lets you apply a specific style to valid elements.
            2. If the user tries to send the data, the browser will submit the form, provided there is nothing else stopping it from doing so (e.g., JavaScript).</p>
        <p>When an element is invalid, the following things are true:

            1. The element matches the :invalid CSS pseudo-class, and sometimes other UI pseudo-classes (e.g., :out-of-range) depending on the error, which lets you apply a specific style to invalid elements.
            2. If the user tries to send the data, the browser will block the form and display an error message.</p>
        <p>The simplest HTML5 validation feature is the required attribute. To make an input mandatory, add this attribute to the element. When this attribute is set, the element matches the :required UI pseudo-class and the form won't submit, displaying an error message on submission when the input is empty. While empty, the input will also be considered invalid, matching the :invalid UI pseudo-class.</p>
        <p>Another useful validation feature is the pattern attribute, which expects a Regular Expression as its value. A regular expression (regex) is a pattern that can be used to match character combinations in text strings, so regexs are ideal for form validation and serve a variety of other uses in JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In some cases, such as legacy browser support or custom controls, you won't be able to or won't want to use the Constraint Validation API.You're still able to use JavaScript to validate your form, but you'll just have to write your own.</p>
        <h3>Using Fetch</h3>
        <p>The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.</p>
        <p>The fetch specification differs from jQuery.ajax() in three main ways:

            1. The Promise returned from fetch() won’t reject on HTTP error status even if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500. Instead, it will resolve normally (with ok status set to false), and it will only reject on network failure or if anything prevented the request from completing.
            2. fetch() won't receive cross-site cookies; you can’t establish a cross site session using fetch. Set-Cookie headers from other sites are silently ignored.
            3. fetch won’t send cookies, unless you set the credentials init option. (Since Aug 25, 2017. The spec changed the default credentials policy to same-origin. Firefox changed since 61.0b13.)</p>
        <p>The fetch() method can optionally accept a second parameter, an init object that allows you to control a number of different settings.</p>
        <p>To cause browsers to send a request with credentials included, even for a cross-origin call, add credentials: 'include' to the init object you pass to the fetch() method.</p>
        <p>The Headers interface allows you to create your own headers object via the Headers() constructor.</p>


        <h2>Code Examples</h2>
        <h3>Form Validation</h3>
        <code><form>
            <label for="choose">Would you prefer a banana or a cherry?</label>
            <input id="choose" name="i_like" required pattern="[Bb]anana|[Cc]herry">
            <button>Submit</button>
          </form></code>
        <h3>Using Fetch</h3>
        <code>fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => console.log(data));</code>
        <code>fetch('https://example.com', {
            credentials: 'include'
          });</code>
        <code>const content = 'Hello World';
            const myHeaders = new Headers();
            myHeaders.append('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
            myHeaders.append('Content-Length', content.length.toString());
            myHeaders.append('X-Custom-Header', 'ProcessThisImmediately');</code>
