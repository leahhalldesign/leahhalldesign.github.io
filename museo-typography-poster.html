            <p>Advertising and marketing has been using posters to promote for many, many decades now. If a poster is well-designed, it will sell the product for you. My goal during the design of this Museo Poster, to design a poster that sells the Museo typeface to other designers.
            </p>
            <p>To complete this poster, I added the name of the typeface 'Museo', along with all the styles that comes with it, the foundry and designer, the full alphabet and numbers, and a brief history about the typeface. I thought that all of this information was needed to properly sell the typeface.</p>
            <p>The poster explains in the history that the 'Museo' typeface was originally created from the idea of a 'bent' U. This history is the reason why I decided to make a portion of the giant letter U the focal point of the poster. It is the defining point of the typeface. I then used visual hierarchy to draw the eyes to the most important information on the poster, then slowly lead to the least important information that if not read the poster still makes sense, but if read it adds to the overall concept of the poster. I decided to keep the color scheme simple to keep the attention on the typeface. The coloring only adds to the visual hierarchy of the poster.
