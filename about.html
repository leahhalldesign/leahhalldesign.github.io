                    <h4>Summary</h4>
                    <h2>What I'm About</h2>
                    <p>I'm a User Experience Designer from British Columbia, Canada currently living in New Jersey, USA. Thanks to my study background in web design & development and user experience design,
                        I know how to make beautiful products with user experiences that work even better than they look.</p>
                    <p>In my experience, websites should not only give information, but should communicate a unique experience that is specific to your brand.</p>

                    <h4>Background Story</h4>
                    <h2>Following My Passion</h2>
                    <p> I have always fought to find something that I would be excited to do each day.
                        I was ecstatic when I first got my job as a UX Researcher. It was fascinating to see how wrong
                        our assumptions can be and how much we let our own biases affect our work. </p>
                    <p>This foundational knowledge helped put everything into perspective once I became a UX Designer. I still 
                        conducted my own research for many of my projects, but on the ones I didn't, I understood the research better
                        so that I knew how important it's application into the website was. 
                    </p>
                    <p>After doing this for a while, I still never get bored of going through the research, design, and development processes
                        to improve a product. I am passionate about the effect that proper research and design can have on a website.

                    <h4>Why Design?</h4>
                    <h2>Keeping Things Simple</h2>
                    <p>Iâ€™ve had a blast designing things that people love. As technology gets more complex, I have the unique opportunity to make complicated processes simple and easy&nbsp;to use.</p>
                    <p>Design offers a unique experience by allowing us to show instead of tell why our business is different. 
                        This is my favorite aspect of design and is why I love creating simple and thoughtful experiences with soul.
