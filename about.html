                <h2>What I'm About</h2>
                <p>I'm a User Experience Designer from British Columbia, Canada currently living in New Jersey, USA. Thanks to my study background in web design & development and user experience design,
                    I know how to make beautiful products with user experiences that work even better than they look.</p>
                <p>In my experience, websites should not only give information, but should communicate a unique experience that is specific to your brand.</p>     
            </div>
            <div class="background-story">
                <h4>Background Story</h4>
                <h2>Following My Passion</h2>
                <p> I have always fought to find something that I would be excited to do each day.
                    I was ecstatic when I first got my job as a UX Researcher. It was fascinating to see how wrong
                    our assumptions can be and how much we let our own biases affect our work. </p>
                <p>This foundational knowledge helped put everything into perspective once I became a UX Designer. I still 
                    conducted my own research for many of my projects, but on the ones I didn't, I understood the research better
                    so that I knew how important it's application into the website was. 
                </p>
                <p>After doing this for a while, I still never get bored of going through the research, design, and development processes
                    to improve a product. I am passionate about the effect that proper research and design can have on a website.

                <h4>Why Design?</h4>
                <h2>Keeping Things Simple</h2>
                <p>Iâ€™ve had a blast designing things that people love. As technology gets more complex, I have the unique opportunity to make complicated processes simple and easy&nbsp;to use.</p>
                <p>Design offers a unique experience by allowing us to show instead of tell why our business is different. 
                    This is my favorite aspect of design and is why I love creating simple and thoughtful experiences with soul.
