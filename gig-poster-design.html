        <h1>Gig Poster Design</h1>

            </div>
            <p>The goal of this project was to create a gig poster for a non-existent band to work on and improve my idea creation. The idea was to not have a band name to stretch and just solely focus on unique design that would draw attention for a gig. 
            </p>


            <h2>The Sketching Process</h2>
                <div class="two-grid enlarge">
                    <img src="images/gig/sketch1.jpg" alt="first page of gig poster sketches">
                    <img src="images/gig/sketch2.jpg" alt="second page of gig poster sketches">
                </div>
                <p>During the sketching process, my goal was to get as many component ideas together that I could to see what different parts I could have work together for my gig poster design. I knew that every part of the design needed to have a purpose and to support my goal, so I kept that in mind as I sketched all the ideas that came into my mind.
                </p>
            
            <h2>The Halfway Point</h2>
                <div class="small-img shadow enlarge">
                    <img src="images/gig/draft.png" alt="gig poster draft">
                </div>
                <p>Throughout this project I made sure to get feedback from my audience, my team, and my mentor. The feedback that I received helped me to further improve my work. The biggest feedback that I received from my draft was that I should stick to either one or two typefaces instead of having three. This was very helpful feedback and since I was just in the process of trying out the different typefaces and seeing what worked, I was happy to limit them. In my final design I now have the same typeface for all of the information except for the place where the face is. I was also told that "theatre" was a little difficult to read and that the red and blue for the hair got a little muddled together. </p>
                <p>To implement this feedback, I chose a different typeface to base "theatre" from and worked on keeping more spacing between the letters. I also made the red part of the hair a solid background color and adding some padding between the edge of the red and the blue so that the colors worked together better.</p>
                <p><i>*I used Weyes Blood as a band name place holder at this point before I decided on my final band name.</i></p>

            <h2>The Final Design</h2>
                <div class="small-img shadow enlarge">
                    <img src="images/gig/gigposter-final.png" alt="gig poster final design">
                </div>
                <p>Now that I am at the end of my project, I see that I have achieved my initial goal to improve my ideation process and stretch my limits from what limited ideas I was able to come up with before. I made sure to create composition sketches throughout the entire design process instead of just at the beginning like I usually do, which ended up helping me stretch my design a lot further than I originally was able to.</p>
