        <h1>'A Unique View on Flowers' Sticker Set</h1>

            <p>The purpose of this project was to create a set of three stickers with a cohesive theme and design. concept I came up with was to use flowers in situations that they would not usually be in to view something beautiful in a different light.</p>

            <div class="final">
                <img src="images/sticker-set/sketch1.jpg" alt="sketches for sticker idea 1">
                <img src="images/sticker-set/sketch2.jpg" alt="sketches for sticker idea 2">
                <img src="images/sticker-set/sketch3.jpg" alt="sketches for sticker idea 3">
            </div>
            <p>I started the design process with some sketches. I wasn't fully sure what direction I wanted to go at the beginning, so I wrote a list of as many themes as I could think of. Once I chose my theme, I started sketching different variations of that theme to see how I wanted design and style my stickers. This design process helped me decide on three basic ideas for my sticker set.
            </p>

            <div class="final">
                <img src="images/sticker-set/stickers-01.png" alt="draft for sticker idea 1">
                <img src="images/sticker-set/stickers-02.png" alt="draft for sticker idea 2">
                <img src="images/sticker-set/stickers-03.png" alt="draft for sticker idea 3">
            </div>
            <p>My initial draft for this sticker set was very rough, but I wanted my audience to be able to view a rough idea of the stickers to that I could get feedback on them. The first important feedback that I implemented into my final design was that in the second sticker the hand should be facing the other way so we can see the fingers to better show it's childish characteristics. As you can see in the final, I flipped the hand around and made it chubbier and more rounded to make it more obvious that it is a child's hand. The second feedback that helped improve my design was that I needed to make the hand in the first sticker more proportionate and add detail to show the smokers more shrivelled hands. I incorporated this feedback by evening out the length of the fingers, then adding harsh knuckle detail and a more specific wavy line outlining the hand.

                <img src="images/sticker-set/stickers-presentation.png" alt="sticker set display">
            </div>
            <p>In the end, I was able to successfully ideate and design a cohesive set of three stickers that are similar in design and theme. The theme of flowers in unusual settings really shows here since you never see flowers in any of these situations, but these designs still provide a unique view on ordinary, everyday objects.
