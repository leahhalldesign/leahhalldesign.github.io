            <p>Your business card is the first impression that a lot of people have of you. Especially as a designer, you want your business card to stand out as well-designed to give the impression that you are qualified to do design for that person. 
                </p>
            <p>A business card, like any design used for business, needs to be memorable, professional, and personal. Personally, I like to focus on simplicity in my designs, so that’s what I focused on during the design process of my business card. When I design a business card for someone whose business is more flamboyant then I design&nbsp;it&nbsp;accordingly. </p>
            <p>During the process of designing my own business card, the main objectives that I focused on were alignment and hierarchy. The use of alignment allowed for the information to be the focus and not the design. Design is supposed to support and communicate the information correctly, not be the main focus. As for hierarchy, by using certain colors, fonts, font sizes, and font weights, I was able to clearly illustrate what the most important information on the page is and what the best ways to contact me are. </p>
            <p>Along with alignment and hierarchy, I also practiced the use of spacing in my design. When a designer uses spacing properly, it makes it clear to the viewer what information relates to the rest. To begin with, you can tell that this is a business card for ‘Leah Ogden’ and that she is a UX/UI Designer. Since the contact information is aligned closely underneath the title, it is easy to tell that it’s informing you how you can contact or learn more about Leah Ogden. The branding on the left-hand side of the card is not as close as the rest of the information, but since the colored lined is connected to the contact information it is also clear that it’s the branding for Leah Ogden. 
                </p>
            <p>Every single detail matters in design. Especially in branding, one mistaken tiny detail and people could not trust your company. It’s as simple as making a small typo. When I designed this business card, I made sure to not only check over and over again for mistakes I might have made or details that could be improve, but I also made sure to have others check my work as well. This process ensures that I never leave anything up for chance and that the end result with always be the best it can be.</p>
