        <h1>Fair Food Icon Set</h1>
            <div class="single-img shadow">
                <img src="images/mockup/fairfood-icons-lrg.png" alt="fair food icons display">
            </div>
            <p>The purpose of this project was to create a set of 12 cohesive icons. I chose to create icons representing various foods and beverages that you get by attending a fair, targeting everyone that is missing experiences like fairs, festivals, and concerts because of the current pandemic. 
            </p>

            <h2>Sketching</h2>
                <div class="single-img shadow">
                    <img src="images/fairfood-icons/sketch1.jpg" alt="Ideation sketches for fair food icons">
                </div>
                <p>The first step for creating this icon set was to sketch out any and every idea that came to mind when I thought of fair food (left side). After I had a strong amount of ideas to work with, I took some time deciding what consistency I wanted in the design of each of these icons (right side). </p>
                <div class="two-grid shadow">
                    <img src="images/fairfood-icons/sketch2.jpg" alt="Square fair food icon sketches">
                    <img src="images/fairfood-icons/sketch3.jpg" alt="Square fair food icon sketches">
                </div>
                <p>I decided on designing all of my icons with the base of a tall, rounded rectangle to keep them coherent. I made this design choice because I wanted these icons to represent fun and enjoyment. The rounded corners help portray a lack of intensity and severity, and the consistency in the similar-sized rectangles help the viewers to experience something they've seen a lot into something new.</p>
                <p>After I chose how I would be designing these icons, I drew composition sketches for every fair food that I could think of that would support the purpose of this project.</p>

            <h2>Initial Icons</h2>
                <div class="small-img enlarge">
                    <img src="images/fairfood-icons/initial-icons.png" alt="Initial fair food icon set">
                </div>
                <p>I started digitizing my composition sketches and quickly realized that some ideas were better than others. For example, the icon in the top right was designed as a pickle, but no one seemed to understand that and assumed it was a watermelon. So what I did was turn the pickle into a watermelon, which I ended up liking a lot better anyways. I also received feedback that my ice cream icon looked out of place with its duller colors, and the lemonade icons perspective was off. I took the time to update these icons based on the feedback I received, and worked on keeping my icons consistent in purpose and design.</p>

            <h2>Final Icon Set</h2>
                <div class="single-img">
                    <img src="images/fairfood-icons/fairfood-icons-final.png" alt="Final fair food icon set">
                </div>
                <p>After choosing which icons best representing the purpose of this project and working hard to keep them coherent, I ended up with this bright and fun icon set to give anyone that is currently missing attending fairs an even bigger reason to look forward to when their next state fair opens.
