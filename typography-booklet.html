            <p>Every design decision that you make should have a reason behind it. For example, every design decision that I made during the design process of this book was made based on the article that the booklet was being made for. This is how a great designer approaches any design decision, by incorporating what the design is based on.</p>
            <p>When choosing the colors for this booklet, I read the article over and over to see what colors I could pull out of it. I thought of perfection and how when people think of perfection they think of white or light colors. The background of the booklet is white, so I wanted to keep the primary color light while still in contrast with the background. That is how I chose the pale yellow color as one of the primary colors for this booklet. I knew that the other primary color needed to contrast the pale yellow color, and with that I also thought of the 'eventually' in the title. The title of this article 'Be Ye Therefore Perfect – Eventually' makes me think of the eventually as a contrast and contradiction in the title. when I think of something that contradicts perfection, I think of dark, deeper colors. However, the 'eventually' also is meant to give hope that you are not required to be perfect right now. With all of this in mind, I decided on a deep blue color with a little bit of a light touch to it. It's in contrast to perfection, but it still illustrates hopefulness. </p>
            <p>I made similar decisions with the typefaces that I chose and for the majority of the design decisions that I made in the design process of this booklet. Obviously, there were a few design decisions that simply went well with the other decisions I had made, but those design choices were small and were only there to compliment the bigger design choices.
