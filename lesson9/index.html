        <h2>Notes</h2>     
        <h3>The Window Object</h3>
        <p>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.</p>
        <p>The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box. The message is provided as an argument to the method, and undefined is always returned.</p>
        <p>The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel. It returns the boolean values of true if the user clicks OK, and false if the user clicks Cancel.</p>
        <p>The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text. This text is then returned as a string when the user clicks OK. If the user clicks Cancel, null is returned.</p>
        <p>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. It contains a number of properties that provide information about different fragments of the URL. The href property returns the full URL as a string.</p>
        <p>The protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used (such as http , https , pop2 , ftp etc.). Note that there is a colon ( : ) at the end.</p>
        <p>The host property returns a string describing the domain of the current URLandthe port number (this is often omitted if the default port 80 is used).</p>
        <p>The hostname property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL.</p>
        <p>The port property returns a string describing the port number, although it will return an empty string if the port is not explicitly stated in the URL.</p>
        <p>The pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the domain.</p>
        <p>The search property returns a string that starts with a “?” followed by the query string parameters. It returns an empty string if there are no query string parameters.</p>
        <p>The hash property returns a string that starts with a “#” followed by the fragment identifier. It returns an empty string if there is no fragment identifier.</p>
        <p>The origin property returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page originated from. This property is read-only, so cannot be changed.</p>
        <p>The reload() method can be used to force a reload of the current page. If it’s given a parameter of true , it will force the browser to reload the page from the server, instead of using a cached page.</p>
        <p>The assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter, for example.</p>
        <p>The replace() method is almost the same as the assign() method, except the current page will not be stored in the session history, so the user will be unable to navigate back to it using the back button.</p>
        <p>The toString() method returns a string containing the whole URL.</p>
        <p>The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current browser session. Avoid confusing this with the new HTML5 History API. </p>
        <p>The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current page.</p>
        <p>The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page.</p>
        <p>A new window can be opened using the window.open() method. This takes the URL of the page to be opened as its first parameter, the window title as its second parameter, and a list of attributes as the third parameter. </p>
        <p>The close() method can be used to close a window, assuming you have a reference to it.</p>
        <p>The window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on.</p>
        <p>Each window object contains a document object.</p>
        <p>The write() method simply writes a string of text to the page. If a page has already loaded, it will completely replace the current document.</p>
        <p>To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript’s “cookie jar”, using the document.cookie property.</p>
        <p>A cookie’s value can be changed by reassigning it to document.cookie using the same name but a different value.</p>
        <p>To see the current contents of the cookie jar, simply enter document.cookie.</p>
        <p>To remove a cookie, you need to set it to expire at a time in the past.</p>
        <p>The window object provides some useful methods for scheduling the execution of a function, and for repeatedly executing functions at regular intervals.</p>
        <p>The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter. It can also cancel the timeout using the window.clearTimeout() method. </p>
        <p>The window.setInterval() method works in a similar way to window.setTimeout() , except that it will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds.</p>
        <p>To stop this, we can use the window.clearInterval() method and the variable repeat as an argument (this is because the window.setInterval() method returns its ID, so this will be assigned to the variable repeat).</p>
        <p>The setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements on a web page.</p>
        <h3>HTML5 APIs</h3>
        <p>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. </p>
        <p>The information contained in the attributes can be used to identify particular elements. For example, all the elements with an attribute of data-dropdown could be identified as dropdown menu. The values of the attributes can also be used to filter different elements. For example, we could find all the elements that have a data-rating value of 3 or more.</p>
        <p>Each element has a dataset property that can be used to access any data- attributes it contains. Here’s an example of some markup.</p>
        <p>The data-powers attribute can be accessed using the following code.</p>
        <p>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. This means it can be used to find the user’s exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving. </p>
        <p>The position object passed to the youAreHere() function has a coords property with a latitude and longitude property, which together give the coordinates of the device.</p>
        <p>position.speed property returns the ground speed of the device in meters per second.</p>
        <p>position.altitude property returns an estimate of the device’s altitude in meters above theWGS84ellipsoid, which is a standard measurement for the center of the Earth.</p>
        <p>position.heading property returns the direction the device is moving in. This is measured as a bearing in degrees, clockwise from North.</p>
        <p>position.timestamp property returns the time that the position information was recorded.</p>
        <p>An audio clip can be inserted into a page with the <audio> tag, using the src attribute to point to the audio file.</p>
        <p>A video clip can be inserted with the <video> tag, using the src attribute to point to the movie file</p>
        <p>The play() method will start the clip playing from its current position.</p>
        <p>The pause() method will pause the clip at its current position.</p>
        <p>The volume property is a number that can be used to set the audio volume</p>
        <p>The muted property is a boolean value that can be used to mute the audio.</p>
        <p>The currentTime property is a number value that can be used to jump to another part of the clip.</p>
        <p>The playbackRate property is used to fast-forward or rewind the clip by changing its value. A value of 1 is playback at normal speed.</p>
        <p>The loop property is a boolean value that can be set to true to make the clip repeat in a loop.</p>
        <p>The duration property can be used to see how long the clip lasts.</p>

            << "name=Batman"
            document.cookie = 'city=Gotham'
            << "city=Gotham"</code>
