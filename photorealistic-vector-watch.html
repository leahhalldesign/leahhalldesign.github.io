        <h1>Photorealistic Vector Watch</h1>

            <p>The purpose of this project was to take a product image of a watch and recreate it in photorealistic style with vector graphics. I chose a Movado watch to recreate. The goal of this project was not only to create a watch that looked realistic and identical to an image, but to force myself to really notice the colors, reflections, shading, and all the tiny details of objects that I see in my day-to-day life.</p>

            <div class="two-grid shadow">
                <img src="images/watch/sketch1.jpg" alt="sketches of watches and watch components">
                <img src="images/watch/sketch2.jpg" alt="sketches of watches and watch components">
            </div>
            <p>Throughout the sketching process of the project, my goal was to get as many ideas of different watch components on the page as possible. I knew that each individual detail in this project would be important, and wanted to familiarize myself with all of&nbsp;the&nbsp;components. 
            </p>

            <div class="single-img enlarge">
                <img src="images/watch/watch-draft.png" alt="mid-project vector watch draft and comparison to orginal image">
            </div>
            <p>During this project, I made sure to get feedback from my coworkers, mentor, and peers. Some of the most helpful feedback that I received was, first, that I needed to add more shading at each layer of the watch. While I was still in the process of working on this, I made sure to keep shading in mind and focus my attention on how I could use shading to completely replicate the original image. The second most helpful feedback that I received was to bring more attention to the individual ticks, since they currently looked copied and pasted. I took the time to make changes to each individual tick and to ensure that the lighting source for each one was correct.
